<h1>Sukiyaki</h1>


<p>Shouxi burn can also be called hoe burn. It is said that it originated in ancient Japan. In addition to busy farming, farmers simply use the flat parts of iron farm tools available at hand, such as hoes and plows, to barbecue meat on the fire, so it is named.</p>
<p>By the 21st century, of course, Shouxi roast has long been more than just barbecue on simple iron tools. It has not only become a representative cooking for Japanese people to taste top beef; When families get together or celebrate, they often carefully prepare for the whole family to enjoy.</p>
<p>As we all know, Shouxi is very delicious.</p>
